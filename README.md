## Introduction
A PCR product is a single linear DNA sequence. This sequence is the results of the interaction of many different DNA "objects". 
We are focusing here in a case where there are two objects: 
* A DNA template (as a viral genome)
* An unknown DNA
In some cases a read contains interspersed and rearranged version of a DNA template. 
The structure of a read that contains AAV genomes is often highly rearranged
We developed a tool that are able to reconstruct the topology of the template on the read and viceversa. 
From it we derived a second tool that is able to trim in a particular way
